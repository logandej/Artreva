    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Your work here, Akami, does not seem to be on the list of exhibitions...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100026
    m_Localized: I'll have to inform the organizer. Other artists have done the same...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: What do you have in mind when you present these meaningless works?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100028
    m_Localized: It's too much now, no one is respecting the rules, I'm going to

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Akami, my creator, has disappeared...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100031
    m_Localized: But where did he go? The gloves you wear have freed my soul from
      my sculpture, and as long as eyes are cast upon me, I can exist.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100032
    m_Localized: We absolutely must find Akami! Only he can improve these gloves
      and perhaps free the souls of the other works locked away by this critic.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100033
    m_Localized: To find Akami, you must find his here. For him, she represents the
      one who most embodies freedom.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100034
    m_Localized: Yes, that's it! She was hidden behind you, but you were able to
      free your gaze and your vision.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100035
    m_Localized: Another one of your meaningless works, Akami...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100036
    m_Localized: This is not art, it is a fraud!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100037
    m_Localized: It's time to clean up this nonsense
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100038
    m_Localized: and keep only what is worth it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Don't you understand anything?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: It's not up to you to decide what has value or not!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100041
    m_Localized: Every work tells a story, even the ones you despise!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100042
    m_Localized: Leave this work alone!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: You can't just erase what you don't understand!

    m_Localized: "Oh\u2026 interesting."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100045
    m_Localized: These gloves... So they would be able to understand contemporary
      art better than me?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100046
    m_Localized: All right, let's see what they're worth.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100047
    m_Localized: My Gloves!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100048
    m_Localized: Well... that settles it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100049
    m_Localized: If you really want to defend these works, then prove their worth!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100050
    m_Localized: Tomorrow we will have a stand at the festival, facing the public
      and the artists.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100051
    m_Localized: It will be up to you to convince people that these creations deserve
      to exist.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100052
    m_Localized: I hope you're prepared to fail.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100053
    m_Localized: "Without gloves\u2026 how will I manage?"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100054
    m_Localized: These gloves never had any power.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100082
    m_Localized: This is a rather disturbing speech... Your vision seems too subjective
      to me...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100081
    m_Localized: The work explores the relationship between time, memory, and forgetting,
      highlighting the fragility of memories and the possibility of renewal.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100055
    m_Localized: They only helped the wearer convince himself that he could understand
      art.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100056
    m_Localized: You see, you've always been able to understand what artists want
      to express.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100057
    m_Localized: It's your perception that matters. Not a magic tool.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100058
    m_Localized: Tomorrow you won't have gloves to help you.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100059
    m_Localized: Just you, your gaze, and your ability to convey what you feel.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100060
    m_Localized: And that's quite enough.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100061
    m_Localized: My thanks to the critics present here, who were able to identify
      such a blatant and scandalous anomaly in our event.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100062
    m_Localized: I'm Koonsa, the organizer of this Biennale. Just yesterday, we intercepted
      several works that weren't on any official list.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100063
    m_Localized: These... creations... have no place here. They are out of control,
      deformed, almost profane. They are not valid representations of contemporary
      art, but aberrations.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100064
    m_Localized: Every illegitimate work will be examined. If their presence cannot
      be rigorously justified, then they will be destroyed immediately.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100065
    m_Localized: "Here is just one of them. A work by a certain\u2026 Warhul."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100066
    m_Localized: I'm not going to question its creator. That would be granting them
      legitimacy they don't have.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100067
    m_Localized: It is up to you, close to Akami, who seems to find meaning in the
      delusions of these crazy artists, to convince me.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100068
    m_Localized: Explain to me. Why does this work deserve its place here?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100069
    m_Localized: The work highlights the struggle for women's rights and the importance
      of equality in society. It recalls past and present struggles for freedom and
      justice.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100070
    m_Localized: I see... there may be more to understand than I thought...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100071
    m_Localized: I'm not convinced... This is your own interpretation, not insignificant
      certainly, but I'm going to need more.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100072
    m_Localized: All right. My turn. Here's another monstrosity.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100073
    m_Localized: Look at her. Incoherent. Indecent. A pastiche of what art used to
      be.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100074
    m_Localized: The work denounces the impact of social media and technology on
      our relationship with nature. It highlights the growing addiction to these
      tools and the ways in which they distance us from our natural environment,
      emphasizing the importance of finding balance and reconnecting with nature.
      Isolation is also a relevant theme, showing how we often find ourselves alone
      in front of our screens, cut off from direct human interaction.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100075
    m_Localized: Explain it, too. Unless you'd rather stay silent and see this deception
      disappear...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100076
    m_Localized: You can say you're doing well... But the next work will be indefensible
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100077
    m_Localized: I'm not sure I follow your personal interpretation. I think I see
      something a little different...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100078
    m_Localized: I am Dachamp, an independent critic.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100079
    m_Localized: "What I see here\u2026 is a fraud. A work lacking coherence, lacking
      mastery.\nAnd yet, it's there."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100080
    m_Localized: So you, who seem to understand her... explain to me why she should
      stay.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100083
    m_Localized: Well, it seems that... we've missed the point.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100084
    m_Localized: We judged too quickly. Without seeking to understand, to feel.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100085
    m_Localized: We looked at these works without really seeing them.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100086
    m_Localized: Contemporary art is not there to please the eye, but to question.

    m_Localized: We have been prisoners of our old standards.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100089
    m_Localized: But today's art is no longer content with pleasing.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73426100090
    m_Localized: He provokes, he denounces, he challenges.
